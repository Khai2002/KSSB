    "Standing in front of the mirror, looking at myself, I'm still not entirely sure how I got talked into this."

    "The room is typical of what I imagine most locker rooms are like."

    "It's fairly small, a little larger than the size of one of Yamaku's normal restrooms but much smaller than the one on my floor in the dorm."

    "There's two standard stalls, two showers, and the row of sinks along one wall."

    "The lighting always seems to be perpetually dim, despite the glare of the fluorescent tubing."

    "The floor is made up of tiles which always feel damp. They constantly feel cold against bare feet, until you step on one of the several metal grates spread around and realize how cold the floor really is."

    "There's also the smell. It's a musty mixture of chlorine, disinfectant, and moisture."

    "You never find that smell anywhere else."

    "One wall has a bank of lockers, about half of which have locks on them."

    "I found one that was unused, and stored the clothes I had changed out of when I came here."

    "Nurse and Saki both seemed right about not many people using the pool this time of day."

    "I haven't seen anyone in the men's locker room. The only sound is the loud hum of an exhaust fan somewhere in the ceiling."

    "So here I stand, in my standard track outfit. Red shorts that don't even come down to mid thigh, and a white ringer shirt edged with red."

    "The last time I wore this, it didn't go so well."

    "Towel slung over my shoulder, hair still a mess, I have to admit it; I look kind of ridiculous."

    "Part of me wants to just blow this off."

    "But I did make a promise to Nurse, and when it comes to him, I have the feeling that the walls have eyes."

    "I wouldn't be surprised if he knows everything that happens in this school."

    "He may have spotted me at the festival himself, but I'm not taking any chances."

    "Besides, the sleeping pills did help me last night."

    "I didn't get any more sleep than I usually do, but the quality of the sleep improved."

    "There's still a few cobwebs in my head, but I'm sure those will clear the second I hit the water."

    "Steeling myself, I walk down the short hallway and down half a dozen stairs into the pool room."

    "The walls open around me, and I get my first look at the area."

    "The room is rather large, probably about four to five times the size of my classroom."

    "Painted cinder-block walls brace up several wide windows near the roof, letting in enough natural light to soften the harsh tones of the ever-present artificial glow from the fixtures over my head."

    "The pool itself fills most of the room, dark tile lines designating lanes across the blue bottom."

    "Stairs on one end are bracketed by silver handrails, and the other end has some sort of strange contraption with a plastic seat attached to a bunch of hydraulics."

    "It doesn't seem that deep, only about a meter and a half or so."

    "There's also a small hot tub behind it near the wall."

    "I never went to many pools as a kid, but this pool looks like it's designed more for swimming laps."

    "I guess it would be a very bad thing if the students that used it couldn't touch the bottom."

    "I get a mental image of Emi trying to tread water and I snicker before I can help myself."

    "I'm the only one here at the moment."

    "I know Saki comes here in the mornings since I've run into her a few times on her way back, but right now the time is a bit later than when we've met up, so I assume I already missed her."

    "It's not like I'm avoiding her for this."

    "I didn't see her yesterday after my appointment with Nurse, but..."

    "I look down to my shirt, pinching the fabric over my scar and pulling it out away from me."

    "This stretches the neck out far enough where I can see the ugly raised scar that invades the surrounding skin."

    "I'm not sure I want to even take the shirt off yet."

    "It may seem silly when you're swimming by yourself, but there's no guarantee that someone couldn't be walking in."

    "And then it would seem even more strange to be seen by someone swimming by myself with my gym shirt on."

    "I sigh."

    "No."

    "Not yet."

    "I can't do it yet."

    "I make my way down to the stairs and place my towel on a hook fastened into the wall for that very purpose."

    "Turning to face the water, I place my hand on one of the railings and dip my foot in."

    "It's cool."

    "Not cold, but cool."

    "Any colder and it would send a shiver up my spine, but this... this is nice."

    "I slowly take a few steps in the pool, the water rising up my calves, knees, thighs..."

    "Uh-oh."

    "As soon as the water hits the bottom of my shorts, I realize that I've made a horrible mistake."

    "The fabric soaks up water almost as fast as I can blink, the coldness marching up my thighs all the way to my waistband."

    "The entire shorts are soaked and I've only barely dipped them a few centimeters into the water."

    "That's not the worst part though."

    "The worst part is that when the fabric becomes wet, it becomes clingy."

    "Swim trunks have netting that... holds everything in place. Gym shorts do not."

    "And given that I treated these as swim trunks and didn't wear anything underneath."

    "Yeah... There's more than one reason I'm glad I'm the only one here."

    "Let's get this over with."

    play sound watersplash volume 0.5

    "I swiftly half-fall, half-leap forward into the water, submerging myself completely and kicking off towards the far end of the pool."

    "I'm down near the bottom, completely weightless as I propel myself forward, the surface of the water above me refracting light as the ripples from my entry spread out ahead of me."

    "I try to see if I can make it all the way to the other end of the pool."

    "No chance."

    "I shoot towards the surface, breaking clean and taking in a few huge gulps of air."

    "I brush my hair back out of my face, and notice with shock that I didn't even make it halfway through the pool."

    "With my feet on the bottom, the water comes up to my chest, and I can feel how heavy the shirt is once it's soaked."

    "I could blame that pitiful swim on the weight and drag, but deep down, I know that's not the case."

    "I let my legs go slack and I sink deeper into the water until I'm treading it."

    "I could just float like this for a while, but the clock on the wall says that I don't have much time before I have to leave."

    "I should probably do a few laps and ease into it."

    "At least with the track I had Emi to guide me."

    "Here, I'm on my own."

    "How hard can it be? I've seen it enough whenever the Olympics are on."

    "With another breath, I continue splashing down the length of the pool in what I hope is decent form like what I've seen on television."

    "My arms windmill and push me forward, my legs kicking in time behind me."

    "In what seems like no time at all, my hand slaps the concrete at the edge of the pool with a sting, causing me to turn around and push off the wall."

    "I make the journey back, the bellows of my breathing the only sound in my waterlogged ears."

    "Keep at it."

    "One full lap."

    "Let's go for another."

    "Two full laps."

    "My lungs are burning from the effort."

    "This is harder than I thought it would be, but this time I can pace myself instead of trying to race someone."

    "Three laps."

    "Am I starting to get this tired already?"

    "Four laps, and I'm already breathing almost as hard as I was on my run with Emi."

    "I come to a stop and place a hand on my chest."

    "My heart is beating faster and harder, but it's steady."

    "Any more than this though, and I'd be pushing it."

    "That should be enough, at least for now."

    "Maybe if I come back later in the week, I can do a few more."

    "I stretch out on my back and float on the surface, feeling my heartbeat slowly return to normal as my body relaxes."

    "This is so much better than running."

    "When you get tired, you don't have to hold up the weight of your body or worry about overheating."

    "There's a lot more prep work than with running, since you have to have a set of clothes merely to get from the dorm to the pool, unless you change into your school uniform in the locker room."

    Saki "Hisao? Is that you?"

    "Both the voice itself and the fact it's calling my name startle me out of my thoughts."

    "I instinctively try and sit upright, however with nothing underneath me, my body folds and my head goes under."

    "There's a second of panic as my sinuses fill with chlorinated water, and I finally get my feet under me."

    "I start coughing the second my head breaks the surface."

    "My hand goes to my nose as I blow it to try and clear it."

    "Damn, that stings..."

    Saki "Are you alright?"

    "The voice says again, from behind me."

    Hisao "Y... yeah, I'm fine."

    "I manage to splutter out as I turn to find the source of it, slicking my hair back again to try and regain some of my lost dignity."

    "I have another shock when I see who it is... and what she looks like."

    Hisao "Saki? What are you doing here?"

    "Saki stands at the bottom of the stairs leading down into the pool area, with a bemused look on her face."

    "Her hair, nearly blonde in the morning light, is pulled back into a ponytail high on the back of her head, causing the honey colored strands to brush just past the nape of her neck."

    "She's wearing a black one-piece with design more for utility than fashion with a higher neckline, but still a very fitting cut that hugs every curve of her body."

    "Even though the amount of light it drinks doesn't allow for more than a suggestion of the figure beneath, her long shapely legs are on full display, a set of black sandals on her feet."

    "That she's holding her cane as usual in one hand and draping a towel over the other arm does nothing to detract from how amazing she looks."

    "I take a second to take it in."

    "I've never seen her in anything but her normal school uniform, and to go from that to this...it's more than a little alluring."

    "The sudden, quick flush I feel despite the coolness of the water is proof of that."

    Saki "I was about to ask you the same thing."

    "That snaps me back to reality, and with horror I just know that she saw me staring."

    "And then with even more terror, I realize her eyes are giving me the same appraisal, but I can't read anything but mild surprise as they widen."

    Saki "Are those... is that a track outfit?"

    "This is the first time she's seen me in anything different."

    "And I'm sure the outfit and circumstances are leaving an absolutely wonderful impression."

    Hisao "Y-yeah. You see, Nurse said I should get some exercise and running with Emi didn't work out so he told me I should go swimming-"

    "And I realize I'm rushing to explain because I'm embarrassed that you just caught me gawking at you and this is me trying desperately to take both our minds off it but I don't think it's workin-"

    Hisao "-but I don't own anything to swim in so I thought I could just swim in this until I was able to get something..."

    "I stop to take a breath, and she's laughing."

    "Not just the light airy laugh I've come to know from her the last week, but a hard laugh that causes her to clutch at her stomach and lean over, almost in a way I would expect of Misha."

    "I'm left with a look of pure confusion, because I don't know why she's laughing or what her laughter is directed at."

    Saki "Nurse put you up to this?"

    Hisao "He didn't put me up to it, he blackmailed me into it."

    "Saki's laughter finally dies down as she hangs up her towel, taking something small and black from its folds that I didn't notice earlier."

    "She makes her way to the edge of the pool, sitting down with her legs dangling in the water."

    Hisao "Why are you here? I mean, I know you try to go swimming every morning but I thought you would have been done by now."

    Saki "I slept in a little too late. I guess I'm still tired from the festival."

    "She admits, taking her tail and stuffing it into the cap with the ease of repetition. She pulls it from the back of her head to the front, snapping it down just below her hairline."

    "A quick smooth motion with her fingers to tuck in the sides, and her hair is completely hidden underneath."

    "Saki pushes off with her hands and slides into the pool with barely a splash, sinking up to her neck."
    
    "When she stands back up, the fabric of her suit has gotten even darker if such a thing were possible, and beads of water that haven't been absorbed are dripping down her arms and the curves of her chest."

    "She looks good, I know she looks good, and she knows I know she looks good."

    Saki "What?"

    show saki smug_swim

    "Saki asks innocently, but the mischievous glint in her eyes gives her away."

    "It's very similar to the same look she gave me from the stairs the first day I met her, or the one she gave me when I asked her about her condition at the festival."

    "It's a look made up of equal parts self satisfaction, curiosity, and encouragement."

    "It's a look that places all the attention in the world on you, as if to say 'Now, what will you do?'"

    "And unlike with Shizune, the unspoken question doesn't seem to challenge, but to encourage you to push your own comfort zones and boundaries to respond."

    "I'm wearing gym clothes in a pool being interrogated by a beautiful girl in a swimsuit who knows she's having an effect on me, and enjoying it."

    "This is about as far out of my comfort zone as I can be."

    Hisao "Just wondering why you decided to put a cap on."

    "I used an entire weeks worth of mental focus to be able to get those words out in a steady voice."

    "My mind is sending me panic signals telling me there's no batter on deck."

    "If she were to counter, I would have nothing left."

    "Saki has me dead to rights, and to my relief, she decides to let it go and answer my question without appearing to give it a second thought."

    Saki "Ugh, and have to deal with chlorine in my hair every day? Swimming once or twice a week is fine, but when you do it every day it damages your hair, and besides, the shampoo I like is way too expensive to use for that."

    Hisao "Oh."

    "I say, leaning back to float. If I make a habit of this in the morning, I wonder if I'll run into the same problem."

    "Just another ball to juggle in my head."

    Saki "So how did Nurse get you to do this?"

    Hisao "He told me he'd tattle on me if I didn't get any exercise, then they'd have to put me in therapy."

    "I mean, logically everything he said made perfect sense, but it just doesn't sit right."

    Saki "Therapy's not so bad. I go twice a week. That's what they use that room for. It's not exactly fun, but you do what you have to."

    "I look down at my shirt, the neckline of which is already stretching due to the weight of the water it's soaked up. I guess we do, don't we?"

    Hisao "You have therapy, you have art club, you have band, and you still find time to swim every morning. Where do you find the time to do all this?"

    Saki "I just do the things that I'm good at and help me to be happy."

    "She answers as if it's the most natural thing in the world. Hearing someone dismiss all responsibility like that is rather shocking."

    Saki "I spend more time after school in the music room now with Mrs. Sakamoto. I think even Nomiya's had it with me too since I missed the last few art club meetings."

    "I can understand the violin, because she's absolutely amazing at it."

    "The swimming, however, kind of puzzles me."

    "Because first of all, this is Yamaku, and second of all, anyone who would see her like this probably wouldn't even notice she had a cane..."

    "I don't have as much time as I want."

    "Something about the way she said that seems... off."

    "I don't know why, and if you asked me to explain it, I couldn't."

    "There may have been a subtle tone shift in her voice, or her eyes flickered away from mine for a second when she said it, or her shoulders might have sagged ever so slightly."

    "And then, something in my mind clicks."

    "Every little bit of information I've learned so far about Saki has been painting a picture."

    "I haven't actively thought about it much, since it's been like putting a puzzle together when you can't see the printed sides of the pieces or even know how many pieces there are."

    "But just for a second, hearing those words and the way she says them gives me a glimpse at what those pieces represent."

    "I don't have as much time as I want."

    "As long as I can play the violin, I'm happy."

    "I'm here because I have a degenerative disorder."

    "I take medications that help with the symptoms, but no cure."

    "I don't know anything about the condition she has."

    "But I've done enough reading, spent enough time in the hospital, to know what the word degenerative means."

    "The conversation flowed so smoothly when she mentioned it at the festival that I didn't think on it when she said it."

    "It's not going to get better."

    "I feel an emotion I haven't felt since I was in the hospital, the second day after my surgery."

    "I was finally coherent enough to listen to what the doctor had to say."

    "My parents stood off to the side for support, but it just felt like they were watching my reactions."

    "As the man in the white coat calmly spoke about arrhythmia, heart attacks, surgery, and what it meant for someone's life expectancy, it was like I wasn't even there."

    "I was watching it from far away."

    "I was standing in the room, next to my parents, listening as this man had to explain to this young kid in a hospital bed why his life as he knew it was over."

    "Poor kid."

    "I've been angry and sad at the world the last few months, and I've also been angry at and sad for myself as well."

    "But I wouldn't have described any of what I felt as pity."

    "And that's exactly what I feel now."

    "I hate myself when that feeling is applied to me."

    "I hate myself even more when I apply it to others."

    Saki "So Hisao, did you do much swimming before you came to Yamaku?"

    Hisao "Not much. There was a public pool near where I lived, but it was always crowded. I didn't really go that much."

    Saki "What about the beach?"

    "Saki asks, her eyes brightening as she mentions it."

    Hisao "I've only been once, when I was really little. We took a day trip and enjoyed it. Mom had always said we would go back, but it never happened and when they both got promotions a few years ago, there just wasn't any time."

    Saki "It's a lot of fun, you should go again if you ever get the chance."

    "Saki says, swimming backwards away from me towards the far end of the pool."

    "She glances up at the clock near the end."

    Saki "I hate to be rude, but I really need to try and get in a few laps this morning before class..."

    Hisao "Oh, don't mind me."

    "I say, making sure to move off towards one side so she has plenty of room."

    "Saki smiles at me, and suddenly, there's a series of splashes as she takes off towards the opposite end."

    "She reaches it there much faster than I did, and I don't think it's just because she's wearing a swimsuit while I'm wearing something much heavier."

    "I watch her as she moves, turning around and kicking back."

    "There's the same type of grace she has when walking, only magnified."

    "There's a purpose in her movements, and an elegance in the way she glides through the water."

    "Even if I had proper attire, there's no way I would be able to do that."

    "Whether it's machismo or embarrassment, I decide I've spent enough time looking at Saki in her swimsuit for now and try to get a few more laps in."

    "I start paddling for the far end of the pool."

    "Saki completes a dozen laps in the time it takes me to do another four."

    "The last two really caught me breathing hard, but I know that's no excuse for me being completely outpaced."

    Saki "You'll never be able to keep up if you keep wearing that!"

    "Saki says playfully as she sits on the pool stairs, most of her body out of the water."

    "She kicks a leg at me, splashing me."

    Saki "We'll have to get you something when we go to the city. We're still on for that, right?"

    "Ah, the city! I was so preoccupied with everything else going on this morning it totally slipped my mind."

    Hisao "Absolutely. What day were you thinking?"

    Saki "This weekend. There's a few other things we need to do though while we're there...I hope you don't mind?"

    "Saki asks tentatively."

    Hisao "Like what?"

    "I say, guardedly."

    "I'm game for anything, but Saki and Chisato like to tease me enough when we get together here at the school."

    "The thought of the two of them doing it away from the school and me a captive audience..."

    Saki "We're going with Mrs. Sakamoto. We're working on... well, there's a project."

    "She explains, enthusiastic but just a bit...embarrassed? No, that's not quite right...but it's a little uncharacteristic."

    Hisao "What kind of project?"

    Saki "It's... music related."

    "Saki hesitantly offers, standing up out of the pool completely, water streaming off her pale legs."

    Saki "Ms. Sakamoto is helping us, um... record some stuff."

    "This sparks my interest."

    "I have my own struggles that I have a hard time discussing."

    "I don't have any idea as to why, but I'm getting this exact same vibe from Saki at the moment."

    "I can't relate to the reason, but I can definitely relate to that feeling."

    "She'd probably continue on if I pressed the issue, but I can tell she doesn't really want to."

    "It's probably best to leave it be for now."

    Hisao "Sounds like fun."

    "I say, trying to cheer her up the same way she's done with me."

    "I didn't expect that there was going to be a teacher chaperoning us, but despite that it does sound like a good time."

    "I'm looking forward to it, but for a spur of the moment excursion on my part, it's starting to sound like it may be a bit pricey."

    "My parents do send me an allowance, but since I just got here I haven't had a chance to start saving some of it away."

    "She says, looking at me with a twinkle in her eyes and her hand hiding her mouth."

    "I can see her shoulders shaking as she's trying not to burst out again."

    "Seeing as how I'm drenched in a track outfit that's absorbed so much water it's stretching out to half again its normal size on my frame, I'm sure I'm exuding the absolute essence of what it means to be manly."

    "Roll with it."

    Hisao "Of course. He needs something like black, or grey, or red. Power colors. If someone finds him, I at least want them to be impressed. Maybe I'll get into less trouble."

    "My words, spoken proudly, are punctuated by the loud splattering of very fat water droplets practically streaming off me and onto the floor."

    "Saki loses her fight to maintain her composure and doubles over, laughing hard."

    "She ends up sitting on one of the benches near her for support."

    "I try to keep up the bravado as I make bold, confident strides towards my towel hanging on the rack, but the corners of my mouth are quivering, threatening to split into a grin at any moment at how absurd it all is."

    Saki "Alright. We'll make sure to get him something that won't embarrass you."

    "While we're on the subject of embarrassing, the cold air against my thighs makes me remember what gym shorts do when wet."

    "Thank god I've already got my towel in my hand and my shirt has stretched down past my waist."

    "I know I look ridiculous, but well... let's just say it could be worse."

    Saki "Speaking of manly, have you figured out what kind of swim trunks you're planning to get?"

    "Jesus, how does she do that?"

    Hisao "No... Probably just something standard."

    Saki "You know, it can be pretty important if you're going to be doing this often. The same company that makes my suit makes one for guys too."

    "I glance over Saki again without trying to make it too obvious."

    Hisao "Does it fit like yours?"

    Saki "Maaaaybe."

    "She answers me with that casual teasing tone."

    "I imagine myself trying to swim in something that basically resembles a pair of briefs... and it's not a good image."

    Hisao "I'll pass, thanks. I have enough issues with my self image."

    Saki "Were you in any sports clubs before you came here?"

    Hisao "I played soccer with some friends once in a while..."

    Saki "Well don't worry. You look fine. Swim for a few weeks and you're only going to look better."

    Hisao "Emi said the same thing about running."

    Saki "Oh come on. You know running isn't exactly my thing, so how do you think I'm able to keep this amazing body?"

    "She asks, twisting towards me seductively, pushing her chest out and running a hand down her thigh."

    "As she finishes those words, she also lowers her eyelids in a sultry stare."

    "The effect is instantaneous."

    "I'm not sure what happens first, either my eyes going wide or my face turning as red as my track shorts."

    "Saki breaks the spell just as fast as she casts it, laughing at my reaction, her cheeks flushed."

    Saki "I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"

    "Do that again without me expecting it and you may just give me another heart attack."

    "Saki turns completely towards me and makes eye contact, with the same seriousness she pinned on me at the festival."

    Saki "You really should stick with it."

    "I think about it for a moment."
    
    Hisao "You do this every morning, huh?"

    "I ask."

    Saki "Uh huh."

    Hisao "Alright, if you can put up with me wearing this until this weekend."

    "I say, looking down at my shirt. I can see the color of my skin in a few areas where the wet fabric rests against my body, but the scar on my chest fortunately isn't raised enough to be seen like that."

    Saki "Good!"

    # To skip, doing sth with this later

    "Saki says, reaching down to her left side, then frowning in puzzlement."

    "She looks at the floor around her, then over towards the edge of the pool where her cane is still laying on the ground."

    Saki "Oh shoot, I left it over there... Hisao, can you please get my cane for me?"

    Hisao "Sure."

    "I say, draping my towel over my shoulders."

    "I stand up and walk over to it, bending down to retrieve it."

    "By the time I make it back to where Saki is, she's already standing with her sandals on."

    Saki "Thanks."

    "She says, taking it from me."

    Hisao "Ugh, I'm going to have to go straight from here to class. I hate it when I have to do that."

    "A quick glance at the clock at the far end of the room confirms that I'll have to be moving really fast to make it myself."

    "I mentally start counting the time in my head."

    "A few minutes to dry off and change, then across to the dorm to change into my school uniform, but that doesn't leave any time for a shower..."

    Hisao "Crap. First time doing this, I didn't bring my uniform with me. I still need to run back."

    Saki "You better get going then."

    "Saki says, as we walk back towards the entrance of the locker rooms as quickly as we can safely manage with the wet floor and her cane."

    "When we reach it and climb the small stairway, Saki stops and turns to face me."

    Saki "Bright and early tomorrow then?"

    "She asks."

    Hisao "Bright and early."

    "I reply."

    "I shouldn't have any problem getting to bed early tonight, as the only thing I really need to do is go see Nurse again and let him know how this morning went."

    "And I can tell him that it went surprisingly well."

    "With a final wave to each other, she turns away and I do the same."

    "The cold tile is under my feet as I round the corner in a few long strides, and I'm frantically stripping down to finish drying before I'm even in front of the locker I stashed my clothes in."

    "I towel myself off furiously, trying to make sure I get everything dry enough to not have my clothes stick to me when I put them on."

    "It only takes a few minutes before I'm dressed in very casual clothing."

    "All I could think to grab was normal pants and an undershirt."

    "It may not have been a problem walking to the pool because it was so early, but now with students and faculty walking around campus because class is about to start, I'm sure to get a few strange looks."

    "Eh, let them look."

    "If Nurse has as many spies around the school as everyone thinks he does, then word should get back to him and he won't be able to doubt me."

    "That settles it."

    "Tomorrow, I'm bringing my uniform and just showering here."

    "If nobody uses the pool this time of day, then I know I won't run into Kenji or anyone else who might use the shared dorm bathroom."

    "I brought a plastic bag to carry my wet clothing back to the dorm, so I hastily wrap the shirt and shorts into the towel and stuff the whole bundle inside."

    "Maybe one of my undershirts would be better for this, or I might just go shirtless in the morning."

    "Yeah, right."

    "Regardless of what I decide to do about the shirt, I don't have any options about the track shorts until I can buy a suitable replacement, so I resign myself to wearing them again the next day."

    "But I'm definitely going to be wearing something underneath them."
