    "The water seems a bit colder than usual this morning."

    "My breath hitches in my throat as I step off the stairs and plunge myself in up to my neck, but I shake it off and use the shock to kickstart my routine."

    "I start to make long, powerful strokes towards the opposite side of the pool."

    "Through this whole week, the schedule has been the same."

    "I wake up, I change, I come down to the pool."

    "I swim for half an hour or so, shower, and then I go to class."

    "I have to admit that Nurse was right."

    "Having a routine has helped me tremendously over the last week, and my body is finally adjusting to some sense of normalcy."

    "Knowing what time I'm going to wake up and what I'm going to be doing has done wonders for my insomnia; I haven't had to take another dose of sleeping medication since the initial one Nurse gave me."

    "What hasn't been great for my sleeplessness are the thoughts constantly running through my head about this last week, or more specifically, the day that started it."

    "I reach the edge, slap the concrete, and turn around, pushing off back towards the way I came."

    "That whole day in itself was a blur, looking back on it."

    "And not just because of what happened with Saki, but later that night when I was thinking about it."

    "In the shower that night, my mind was wandering all over the place, branching out from our earlier conversation into a countless number of meanings and possibilities."

    "No matter where my thoughts strayed off to, they all kept coming back to the same two things."

    "It was obviously a very emotionally charged moment, for the both of us, but... why did it feel like there was more to it than that?"

    "And more importantly, why was it that the further I was removed from that moment, did it feel like I had missed something incredibly vital?"

    "All the pieces were bouncing in my head, desperately trying to fit themselves together into a coherent answer."

    "I just knew I had all the information I needed; I was frustrated that it wasn't coming together into a language I could understand."

    "I've always been able to brute-force mental solutions, but try as I might, I couldn't quite grasp it, my mind elusively circling it like the water going down the drain."

    "One lap down."

    "Going for two."

    "Nurse, Mutou, Saki, Emi...everyone I've met since I got here to Yamaku has been trying in their own way to tell me something that was pounding against me as relentlessly as the water beating down on my skin."

    "Everyone has been trying to tell me not to treat the disabilities of others around me as an issue, or that it's only an issue if I choose to let it be one."

    "But I had no idea what that meant, much less how to act on it."

    "When my thoughts replayed back to that first week, something popped into my head and it made it all click."

    "It was the first time I met Rin."

    "Rin never shied away from my condition; in fact, she asked me about it outright."

    "At the time, I was so shocked that someone who barely knew me would ask me about that, or that she saw no problem with doing so."

    "I figured out pretty quickly that 'conventional' isn't a word that really applies to Rin, and that may be why it took so long for that part to fall into place."

    "I was told that I shouldn't make a big deal about my disability, or the conditions of others."

    "But I obviously can't go up to someone like Hanako and ask her why she's scarred, or someone like Emi and ask her why she has artificial legs."

    "But then again there are plenty of other things I wouldn't bring up with people I just met, so why should things like that be any different?"

    "Like anything else, it's just one more thing that fits onto the ladders of friendship that all of us are climbing."

    "Everyone starts out with everybody else the same way."

    "It begins with something simple, like a name."

    "You place your foot on the bottom rung."

    "A birthday, a phone number, the title of a favorite book or song; all helping you climb a little bit higher."

    "The further you climb, the more you learn about someone."

    "Their hopes and their dreams."

    "Their fears and their weaknesses."

    "They also open up to you in ways that they never would if you were still at the bottom."

    "If you ask a friend you just met why he's tired, he may tell you he has a lot of stuff going on at home, and leave it at that."

    "Someone you've known longer may tell you that their parents are fighting, or ask you for your opinion on it."

    "And before you know it, it's going both ways."

    "I complete a second lap, and push off from the wall, letting the momentum carry my body out into the pool, realizing that I'm too preoccupied to keep this up at the moment."

    "At a certain point, someone's condition becomes just like anything else in their life when it comes to other people - you choose to share it or not, or respond to questions about it or not, no different from anything else."

    "Saki never asked me about my heart, saying she figured I would tell her on my own when I was ready."

    "No, not so much when I was ready, but when our friendship progressed to the point where I could tell her."

    "I think she knew that, even if I didn't."

    "Earlier that day, I opened up to her in a way I hadn't opened up to anyone, just from the simple act of discussing my condition and its ramifications openly."

    "Specialists and nurses and doctors don't count; I'm merely numbers on a chart to most of them, and all they are to me are white coats with the colors of their scrubs underneath the only thing distinguishing themselves from each other."

    "And yet... we still weren't on equal footing."

    "When she said that she was too scared to come out and tell me about her ataxia, or the results of it..."

    "I duck my head under the water, letting the coolness leech the heat from my face."

    "I float there for a few seconds with my eyes closed, the feeling of weightlessness permeating through me."

    "Something changed that day between us... which is why it's so confusing that the mood between us is like it didn't happen at all."

    "After a few minutes on the floor, we stood up."

    "I helped Saki into her chair, and after a few more, we left as simply as we came in."

    "It was like after that huge emotional outpouring that left both of us exhausted, there was a tension in the air neither one of us felt entirely comfortable with and that I couldn't seem to let go of, even after both of us left the room."

    "Hence my mindset and subsequent epiphany in the shower."

    "I haven't seen Saki much this last week."

    "Most of the times we've gotten together the last few weeks have been a result of plans made at the pool or just randomly bumping into each other."

    "With Saki's leg out of commission the former hasn't happened, and chance hasn't been on my side with the latter."

    "I haven't seen her at lunch, and the three times I ran into her in the hallways, her body language showed that something serious was on her mind, prohibiting anything more but some small talk."

    "I've only seen Chisato once, and I haven't seen Noriko at all."

    "My body reminds me with a sudden urgency that it needs air."

    "My feet find the bottom of the pool and I stand, breaking the surface and taking in a lungful."

    "Shaking the water from my hair and ears, I hear a sound coming from the end of the room."

    "Cli-chack."

    "Cli-chack."

    "Cli-chack."

    "I turn, and I can tell the sound is coming from the locker room and getting closer, but nothing looks different at the entrance."

    "Cli-chack."

    "Cli-chack."

    "Cli-chack."

    "I know I've heard that sound before."

    "Are those... crutches?"

    "Three seconds later, my eyes go wide as Saki emerges from the small hallway clad in her black swimsuit."

    "True to my guess, she's making her way with the help of a pair of crutches under each arm."

    "Her towel is wrapped around her neck, hair pulled back into the tight ponytail I'm used to seeing on her in the mornings."

    "A glance down her body shows that her knee is no longer wrapped in the elastic bandage she's been sporting the last week, and her ankle is bare as well... even if she's holding it behind herself off the ground."

    Hisao "Saki!"

    "I say, greeting her with the relief I'm feeling at seeing her at the pool for the first time in a week."

    "I'm rewarded with a smile that seems to be mirroring that same emotion."

    Saki "Hey, Hisao. Glad to see you here."

    Hisao "Of course, been here every day this week. Doctor's orders."

    Saki "That's good,"

    "Saki says, her features softening a bit."

    Saki "I'm glad you kept up with it. I was worried you might have dropped it."

    Hisao "Nah,"

    "I say, laying on my back to float."

    Hisao "I'm actually really enjoying this part of the morning, you know?"

    "Saki starts to make her way towards the pool, her movements much more slow and mechanical than they were with the cane."

    "With difficulty, she ever-so-slowly lowers herself to a seated position at the edge, placing her crutches to the side."

    "I can see the effort took more out her than she's willing to let on, so I swim over towards her."

    Hisao "No swim cap today?"

    "I ask."

    "She shakes her head."

    Saki "I'm not going to be doing any laps for a while,"

    "She says, looking down at her leg."

    "My eyes follow hers down to her right ankle, and I'm shocked at what I see."

    "Even though it's been a week, her ankle and the outside of her foot is covered by an ugly bruise, the pale skin stained with angry mottled reds and purples."

    "Saki must see the look of concern on my face."

    Saki "Don't worry,"

    "She says reassuringly."

    Saki "It looks worse than it is. It's going to look like that for a few weeks, but at least it's healing. I guess I just won't be able to wear sandals for a while."

    Hisao "Are you able to get around on it now?"

    "She nods."

    Saki "Only for short stretches. I still wear a brace, and I'll probably use the wheelchair off and on for another few days, but I've been trying to get used to the crutches. I haven't had to use any for a few years."

    "I've been fortunate enough that I've never had to use crutches, so I can't relate."

    "They're much heavier and more cumbersome than her cane, and they look like they would be a challenge, on top of the pain that must still be present from her injury."

    "I can see that they're taking a toll on her; she has her usual fire behind her eyes, but her movements without them are noticeably lethargic."

    Hisao "Want some help?"

    "I offer, moving closer and holding out a hand to her."

    "She could probably move over to where the chair lift is and use that to get into the water, but this seems like it would be easier."

    "Saki ponders for a split second before she smiles in appreciation, and reaches to take my hand."

    "She scoots her hips forward and hops off the edge, her other hand moving to my shoulder for support."

    "The motion presses her body against mine, and I instinctively wrap my other arm around her waist to keep us both from toppling over."

    "I'm not entirely successful, but the water around us lets me lean back with her."

    "I brace my leg and we stop."

    "We're face to face, pressed together, with one set of hands clasped, our free arms around each other."

    "As our eyes meet, I get a flashback of holding her on the floor of the tea room."

    "In an instant, I can see her thoughts must be similar."

    "I can see her cheeks redden."

    "I can feel my own doing the same."

    "It only lasts for two heartbeats before Saki breaks eye contact, along with the spell it induced."

    "She moves away from me, the cold water a stark contrast to her warm body."

    Saki "Thank you,"

    "She says, with a hint of shakiness that my brain rationalizes is the shock of entering the pool."

    "It is rather cold this morning."

    Hisao "No problem,"

    "I answer, moving a pace back as well."

    "And there it is."

    "This tension again."

    "It could just be my imagination, but in its defense, my imagination can make some pretty damned convincing arguments when it wants to."

    "I'm overreacting."

    "Stop."

    Saki "Hisao... I wanted to say I'm sorry,"

    "Saki starts abruptly, catching me off guard."

    Hisao "Huh? What for?"

    "I ask, genuinely confused."

    Saki "I'm sorry for being so out of it this week,"

    "She says, cutting right to the heart of the matter."

    Saki "It hasn't been a good week... there was a test I had to study for, the pain kicked in after I switched to a different medicine, I haven't been able to swim, and it's just been hell."

    Hisao "It's alright,"

    "I say, brushing it off."

    Hisao "It's been a rough week for me too."

    "I don't elaborate on the reasons for it, however."

    Saki "How did your class project go?"

    Hisao "We scored the top grades in the class,"

    "I say, punctuating the first word with a sarcastic emphasis."

    "Saki laughs."

    Saki "How much of the work did you end up doing?"

    Hisao "Most of it,"

    "I grumble."

    Hisao "I learned the hard way that Shizune's much more talented at motivating others than doing the actual work, and once Maeda picked up on that, he didn't care too much about it anymore."

    Saki "Yeah, that sounds about right,"

    "Saki laughs again."

    "I see her closing her eyes to float on her back, not caring that her hair is getting wet."

    Saki "Oh my God, have I missed this..."

    Hisao "Oh yeah?"

    Saki "You have no idea. After being stuck in a wheelchair for the last week, it just feels so good to..."

    "She says, her voice stopping abruptly."

    "Her face quickly appears as if she's just let something slip that she shouldn't, grimacing so lightly that you'd miss it if you weren't looking for it."

    Hisao "Good to what?"

    "I prompt gently, letting her know I'm interested in the answer, but in a tone that lets her know I'm willing to let it go if she wants to."

    Saki "It feels good to be able to move the way I want to again,"

    "She finishes, blushing slightly."

    "I don't know if it's from her answer or her hesitation."

    Saki "It's bad enough with the cane sometimes, but being in that chair..."

    "With a heavy realization, I know that Saki isn't just talking about her difficulties this last week."

    "Like so many other things she says, the meaning goes a lot deeper than just what's shown on the surface."

    "I don't say anything though, giving her time to collect her thoughts."

    Hisao "That's one of the reasons I love swimming so much,"

    "She continues, her voice lilting."

    Saki "I mean... I can't run or dance anymore because of the balance issues... but when you're in the water, none of that really matters, you know?"

    "She turns in a tight circle, the water rippling around her, to prove her point."

    Saki "When you're underwater, diving towards the bottom, swimming just above it... it's like you can fly."

    "I don't have any idea how to respond to this."

    "Just that admission is so much more than she's ever told me before, and with my newly discovered perspective from this last week... I know this is something she would never have told me before that moment a week ago."

    "And to think, she loves to swim so she doesn't suffer any of the problems that come with her ataxia, so she can feel free and uninhibited for just a few minutes every morning..."

    "Something so simple just blows me away."

    "I blush, but I'm hoping she won't be able to see it from this angle."

    Hisao "It's good to see you in the water again,"

    "I blunder out, trying to say something but still keep the conversation somewhat topical."

    Hisao "How long do you think it will be before you're able to do laps like usual?"

    Saki "Another week or two, maybe."

    "Saki tests the range of motion in her leg and winces."

    Saki "I still can't kick because of my ankle, so that will take longer. But at least I can swim again,"

    "She says, a satisfied weariness in her voice."

    "Her focus turns to me and she perks up."

    Saki "What about you? Gotten any faster in the last week?"

    Hisao "A bit,"

    "I reply, puffing up."

    Hisao "Not too much, but I can do more laps now than I could before."

    "Sadly, I don't think my speed is going to improve much as long as I wear a shirt in the water."

    Saki "Good! Endurance is important too. Probably even better for you than speed, really,"

    "Saki affirms."

    Hisao "Don't let Emi hear you say that."

    Saki "What, the 'fastest thing on no legs'? She's fast in sprints, but I think Miura has her on endurance."

    "The name sounds familiar, but a face doesn't come to mind."

    Hisao "Miura?"

    Saki "Miki. I think she's in your class. Tall girl, really tan, long hair, no left hand?"

    "It still sounds insensitive, but the last part of that description is unquestionably the quickest way to narrow down the field."

    "Even so, I wince."

    "Saki catches it."

    Saki "Oh relax. She jokes about how she's happy she only pays half price for a manicure. Just last week she said she was going to go as Rockman for Halloween."

    "The mental image of that pops into my head before I can stop it, and it makes me laugh."

    "I feel guilty for laughing, but I do laugh."

    Saki "So now that you're done with the project, what's next?"

    Hisao "I think Mutou's giving us a breather for a day or two. He's been autopilot for the last two days. I don't know if its because it's a reward for doing well, or a break because we did bad."

    Hisao "I guess it depends on how the other groups did. Probably both, knowing him."

    Hisao "What about you?"

    "I ask."

    Hisao "How's band?"

    "Saki's face falls a bit."

    Saki "Band is okay... Chisato's been wheeling me over there after school since we're both going there anyway... but Mrs. Sakamoto just looks so guilty when she sees me in the wheelchair."

    Saki "That's another reason I can't wait to get out of it."

    Hisao "She doesn't blame herself for what happened, does she?"

    Hisao "I mean, it's not her fault..."

    Saki "I know that, and I've told her that... but she left us to go off with her husband after we said it was okay, and if she was able to take us back to the school like we had planned..."

    "Saki trails off, shaking her head."

    "She doesn't need to continue."

    "I know all about jumping to conclusions, fair or not."

    "A disconcerting thought pops into my head."

    Hisao "She's not going to get into any trouble, will she?"

    Saki "Oh, no... nothing like that. It happened on the weekend, outside of the school, so she wasn't technically being a teacher, so officially, things will be fine...I hope. I think Nurse has something to do with that. Probably said something about how it could have happened any time, whether she was there with us or not,"

    "She says, a bit of anger bleeding into her voice."

    "I want to change the subject."

    Hisao "What about the art club?"

    "Saki takes a few moments before answering, sadness washing over her."

    "When she speaks, it's with a smaller, more resigned tone."

    Saki "Actually... I'm probably going to be giving it up."

    Hisao "Really?"

    "I ask, shocked again."

    "Saki nods, a bit guiltily, as if she knew all along this revelation would have this impact on myself and others."

    Saki "I haven't been there for the last week at all, and even before then, I was missing out on meetings. Besides, there's nobody to take me like Chisato does with band."

    Hisao "I could stop by your class after school and make sure you make it over there, if you're still in the wheelchair for a few more days,"

    "It would be something I could easily do."

    "Saki ponders this, but then shakes her head."

    Hisao "Thank you, but... no. I've made up my mind. I was never in it for the art anyway. It was just something I was doing as part of my therapy, I guess."

    "I nod automatically, but Saki can see I'm not really comprehending."

    "She sighs, then continues."

    Saki "When I first came to Yamaku, the doctors that were treating me suggested I get into the arts club, because it would be good for my hands and motor control. So I did, mainly to keep them and my parents happy, but I never did give up the violin. That's better therapy anyway, and whatever I can't do with it, I can do on my own time... but..."

    "Her voice takes on the monotone of someone giving an explanation for something personal while trying to remain detached from it."

    "It's one I've heard from her before, and one I've used myself more often than I probably should."

    Saki "After what happened that night, I did a lot of thinking this last week. I realized I just don't have the time for both clubs, especially with the recording project with Chisato. Art club was kind of fun, but it's just not as important as the other things to me."

    Hisao "I'm sorry."

    "I say, more to fill the silence on my part."

    Saki "Don't be."

    "She replies with a shrug that sends ripples out from around her body."

    Saki "It's just the way it is."

    "A few more seconds go by."

    Saki "Are you doing anything after classes today?"

    "Saki asks, looking up."

    "I check my mental calendar and find it blank."

    Hisao "I don't think I am, why?"

    Saki "If you were serious... could you take me to the art club after school? I need to talk to Nomiya and make it official, I guess. I could use the emotional support."

    Hisao "Of course. Why, is he bad?"

    Saki "He takes art and what he does very personally. I've been in his club for over two years now, and if I tell him I'm leaving like this, I don't think he's going to take it too well."

    Hisao "Alright. I'll take you there, and then to band afterwards, if that's where you want to go."

    Saki "Thanks,"

    "She says, the traces of her thousand-watt smile visible again."

    Saki "Well, enough about me. What about you? Get in all your laps yet?"

    Hisao "Ah, no..."

    "I sheepishly reply."

    Saki "A few minutes ago you said you were faster. Try one now. I'll time you,"

    "She says teasingly."

    Hisao "How do you know how fast I am?"

    Saki "What, you think you're the only one checking out the available eye candy in the morning?"

    "She winks."

    "Ah, there it is."

    "That feeling that I'm being teased, but not quite; the constant on-edge feeling I have around her that challenges me to keep my own wits sharp."

    "I didn't realize how much I've missed it this last week."

    Hisao "Alright then,"

    "I answer, my voice filled with a fake confidence as I move back towards the end of the pool."

    Hisao "Let's see how I do."

    "I reach the edge and get into my facsimile of a starting position, taking deep, measured breaths."

    "Saki watches the clock at the end of the pool, and when the second hand sweeps past the top of its arc, shouts the wor"

    Saki "go!"

    "I take off, rocketing off the wall with a powerful kick."

    "When the water starts to slow me, I paddle with all the strength I have, trying to time my kicks to keep me surging through the water."

    "A few seconds later I start breathing in time with every stroke, the sound of my blood rushing in my ears."

    "I can feel my heart beating strong."

    "I mentally count down the seconds in my head since I started."

    "I should be reaching the end of the pool about now..."

    "No sooner does that thought occur than I slap the edge."

    "I know I'm making great time."

    "I turn around and power back, giving it everything I have."

    "I feel my body starting to protest, but I ignore it."

    "It's only for a few seconds, but it stretches out to so much more."

    "I reach the end of my lap and stand up, brushing my hair back out of my eyes."

    Hisao "How'd I do?"

    "I pant, looking at Saki."

    Saki "Not bad! You're two seconds faster than you were when you started a few weeks ago!"

    Hisao "That's it?"

    "I say, crestfallen."

    Hisao "I put everything I had into that, and all I managed to shave off was two lousy seconds?"

    Saki "Hey, don't feel bad! That's a huge improvement for only a few weeks."

    Hisao "I thought I'd be faster than that,"

    "I groan."

    Saki "You aren't going to be much faster while you're wearing a shirt,"

    "She says, raising an eyebrow."

    "Just come right out and say it, why don't you?"

    "I look down at the fabric clinging to me, feeling it pull on me, suddenly self conscious."

    Hisao "I guess I won't, will I?"

    "I muse, turning to look at Saki."

    "Her eyes are sparkling with the same look of encouragement I've seen from her when she challenges me to push myself."

    "My heart skips a beat under its intensity, as it always does."

    Saki "Want to try it again?"

    "She offers, her voice soft."

    "I know what she's implying."

    "My fingers come up to my collar, absently brushing it, feeling the roughness of the fabric enchaining my neck."

    "This shirt is weighing me down in more ways than one."

    "I'm scared, but the answer is yes."

    "I do."

    "I do want to try again."

    "Before I can change my mind or think myself out of it, I reach down to the bottom of the shirt and pull it up over my head in one smooth motion, water streaming from it."

    "I crumple it up in my hands and throw it to the side, the sodden garment coming to rest on the concrete with a wet smack that echoes through the room."

    "Now that I've made the decision, I don't want to think too hard about it."

    "Don't think about the cool air on your bare chest."

    "Don't think about how the water feels against it directly."

    "Don't think about the scar you've exposed for the first time to anyone since your operation."

    "Don't think about the girl who can see it."

    Saki "Go!"

    "Saki shouts."

    "Revitalized by adrenaline, I take off again, the water streaming around me."

    "The lack of drag on my body is immediate, and I can feel the difference as I seem to slice through the water, and it just ignites something in me."

    "Powering through, focusing with everything, pushing myself as hard as I possibly can...for the first time in months, I'm truly cutting loose, physically and mentally."

    "It's primal."

    "It's visceral."

    "It's liberating."

    "Excitement swells in my chest with my thundering heartbeat."

    "I push harder..."

    "White hot pain sears through my head while white hot stars sear behind my vision."

    "I try to cry out, but instead I suck in a lungful of water, and start flailing, trying to figure out what the hell just happened..."

    "I vaguely think I hear someone shouting, but it's muffled, as if from a great distance..."

    "My feet manage to find something hard, like concrete, and I desperately hope it's the bottom of the pool."

    "I push up break the above the surface of the water, coughing violently."

    "The coughs rack me so hard I retch, blinking hard to drive back the waves of nausea."

    "I feel hands on my shoulder."

    Saki "Calm down Hisao! Just breathe, you're okay!"

    "Saki's voice rings in my head next to me, its urgency cutting through the fog of agony in my head."

    "I tense up, trying to at least hold still while my body calms down so I don't end up accidentally lashing out and hitting Saki."

    Saki "You're okay,"

    "She says, her hand moving up to the one I have firmly clamped on the top of my head."

    Saki "Let me see..."

    "I try to calm down, sucking air in through my teeth to combat the throbbing in the top of my skull."

    "The pain isn't helped by realization of what just happened and how stupid it was."

    "I was going so much faster than I thought that I slammed headfirst into the wall at full tilt."

    Saki "Hisao, let me see,"

    "Saki says again, with more force."

    "I move my hand away from my head, and I can feel Saki tenderly probing through my hair with her fingertips."

    "I grimace in pain as she touches my scalp and hiss loudly."

    Saki "No blood,"

    "She comforts, her tone soothing."

    Saki "Breathe, okay?"

    "I nod, trying to control my breathing, the tickling in the back of my throat threatening to start another coughing fit."

    "Slowly, slowly, my heartbeat calms down along with my breathing."

    "My head is still pounding, but it's becoming more of a dull roar."

    "With a final slow exhale, I try to regain some equilibrium."

    "That's when I notice where Saki's hands are; one on my shoulder, one splayed out across my chest."

    "Right over my scar."

    "I tense up like a deer in the headlights, my face turning hot."

    "Saki goes quiet when she senses the change in my demeanor."

    "I can't look her in the eyes, so I sense - rather than see - her staring at it."

    "I logically know I can't be like this forever."

    "Someone besides my doctors and family is going to have to see this sooner or later."

    "I even know that it's not practical to wear a shirt in the pool, if for no other reason how harsh the chemicals are on fabric that isn't designed for it."

    "I logically know all this, but damn me if I was hoping it wouldn't come up so soon, and definitely not like this."

    "Saki backs off, her hands sliding back into the water."

    Saki "You okay?"

    "She asks."

    "I nod stiffly, my face still hot."

    Saki "Well, you were definitely faster that time, right up until you hit the wall,"

    "She says, in a lighthearted tone."

    "I chuckle at how absurd what she just said was... and it's a crack in the dam I've tried to erect."

    "I think about the whole situation, about the shirt, the scar, smacking my head, the whole last week and how uptight I've been..."

    "There's an old anecdote I remember hearing once."

    "A man buys a brand new car."

    "He drives it to his friend's house, eager to show it off."

    "He's proud of the car, but he can't fully enjoy it because he's obsessed about the first dent that will end up damaging the beautiful paint job."

    "The friend bends down and picks up a rock."

    "He throws it at the car, leaving a small dent in the door."

    "The man flips out, and asks his friend why he would do something like that."

    "The friend replies."

    "There, now you can stop worrying about it."

    "Before I know it, I'm laughing."

    "Laughing hard."

    "Saki starts too, and soon we're both laughing our heads off, the sound echoing off the walls and ceiling."

    "It doesn't last long because it hurts like hell to laugh, but for the few seconds it does... everything just seems right in the world."

    Saki "Hey,"

    "Saki giggles as she calms down, trying to get my attention."

    Hisao "Hm?"

    "I ask, brushing a tear out of the corner of my eye."

    "Saki's eyes soften as she gives me a smile."

    Saki "Good job."

    "I blush a bit, and unconsciously sink down into the water."

    "It's said in such a way that I know she isn't just talking about shaving seconds off my lap, but something a lot more."

    "A feeling of relief and happiness washes over me."

    "The laughter, the talking, the joking... all if it completely bleeds away the tension over the past week."

    "Now that the hurdle of someone seeing my scar for the first time has been cleared, it all combines to give me an overwhelming feeling of how we're going to be alright."

    "I just wish reaching this point was a bit less painful."

    "I cast another glance in her direction."

    "What exactly are my feelings for this girl?"

    "Complex would be a good word to start with."

    "For starters, she's not only been kind to me, but there's a sincerity and genuine aspect to it that I haven't felt much from others."

    "She had no reason or motivation to talk to me the day I met her while searching for art supplies."

    "She had no reason to walk me back to the art wing, or rescue me from the wrath of Shizune and Lilly when they were dragging me into their fight."

    "Granted, she's made use of me since then when it comes to helping her out, but none of it seems forced."

    "It seems natural, like what you would do for anyone you were friends with."

    "You need help, so you ask for it."

    "You can offer help, so you do."

    "Everyone talks about how any form of relationship is give-and-take, but I don't think I've ever been in one that meant it quite so literally as this one."

    "Saki has quickly become one of my good friends here, and indeed, a better friend than some of the people I knew at my old school."

    "While a huge part of it is due to Saki being so openly honest and friendly, I know now that it's just as much on me for choosing to open up to her."

    "For letting her climb the ladder."

    "The more I learn about this girl, and the incredible person she is... the more I want to know."

    "I want to climb higher."

    Saki "Got one more in you?"

    "She asks."

    "I put up my hands in protest."

    Hisao "No thank you. I'm done for the day."

    "Saki laughs."

    Saki "I figured that was pushing it. Hope that won't put you off trying again tomorrow."

    "It only takes a minute before I answer."

    Hisao "Not a chance. Just... not today."

    Saki "Yeah, I think I'm done too... we don't have much time before we have to get to class,"

    "She observes, looking at the clock again."

    Hisao "Let me get out and I'll give you a hand,"

    "I say, but Saki's already shaking her head."

    "Saki points to the chair lift across the pool and starts to move towards it."

    Saki "No, not this time. I need to use that. Can you grab my crutches for me, though?"

    Hisao "Alright,"

    "I answer, swimming towards the stairs to climb out."

    "I keep an eye on Saki though, my curiosity getting the better of me as I've never seen one of these things in action."

    "Saki reaches the metal contraption, and reaches out to push a button on its base."

    "It comes to life with a whir and a slight hissing noise, and I watch the nest of gleaming pipes start to unfold."

    "The seat takes a few seconds to swing up in an arc and come down, lowering itself into the water."

    "After a few seconds, Saki hoists herself into it and presses a second button on the arm of the chair, causing it to reverse its previous motions, a bit louder with the added strain."

    "I almost forget what I'm supposed to be doing."

    "I take a few long steps over to grab her crutches and towel as an afterthought, and make my way around the perimeter of the pool."

    "I reach Saki as the chair returns to its original position with a metallic clunk."

    "Saki stays seated and takes the towel from me."

    "She briefly runs it over her arms, legs, and feet before reaching a hand up to me, an expectant look in her eyes."

    Saki "Can we move to the bench? The floor's too wet here,"

    "She says, looking down."

    "The puddle from the chair and our combined bodies has thoroughly soaked the concrete where we're standing, and I can see why she doesn't want to take the risk of trying to get her crutches under her."

    Hisao "Sure,"

    "I say, taking her hand in mine."

    "I help her to her feet, and she puts her arm around my shoulder again, the way she did the night she hurt herself."

    "Unlike that night though, she's able to put weight - albeit a little - on her right ankle."

    "We make our way to the bench by the entrance of the locker room and I gingerly help her to take a seat."

    Hisao "One sec,"

    "I say, looking up and searching the room."

    "I find what I'm looking for, huddled up against the wall."

    "I take a few seconds to walk over to where my shirt figuratively and literally puddled on the ground, and bend down to pick it up."

    "Saki has taken the tail out of her hair and is vigorously drying it with the towel, her motions uncharacteristically frantic."

    "I'm walking back towards her when she moves the towel away, and I come to a dead stop when I see the results of her efforts."

    "Her hair is drier than it was before, for sure."

    "It's also poofed out and pointing in every conceivable direction."

    "I laugh again."

    "I can't help it."

    "Saki knows exactly why I'm laughing, and shoots me a death glare as she tries to comb back the unruly mess with her fingers."

    Saki "See, this is why I wear a swim cap,"

    "She growls in frustration, meeting with little success in trying to control the situation."

    "She finally settles for pulling it back into another tail just to get it out of her eyes, but it's not nearly as neat or orderly as the one she walked in with a while ago."

    "Still chuckling, I wring my shirt out as I walk back to the bench, the drops of water leaving a trail on the concrete."

    "I give it a shake to spread it out and slip it on, realizing too late that the shirt has turned ice cold from landing right under the air conditioning vent."

    Hisao "Damn, that's cold!"

    "I say, grabbing my own towel and wrapping myself up in it."

    Saki "Serves you right for laughing,"

    "Saki chides, sticking her tongue out at me."

    Hisao "Well, I'm supposed to have somewhat messy hair,"

    "I shoot back."

    Hisao "How are you going to handle that?"

    "I ask, raising my eyebrows at the barely contained bird nest adorning her head."

    Saki "Give me ten minutes in the shower and I'll work miracles,"

    "She answers pridefully."

    "I laugh and continue to dry myself off, having much better success with my own hair than Saki did with hers, apparently."

    "Fortunately my hair will be back to normal with just a little clean water and a comb."

    Hisao "I'm sure I'll see later today,"

    "I say, bending down to get my legs."

    "Bad idea."

    "The change in posture sends blood rushing to my head."

    "The pain from earlier comes surging back, eerily pounding in time with my pulse."

    "I quickly stand back up, resolving to check in the mirror."

    "I know I'm going to have a lump."

    "I'm just hoping it won't be too bad, or noticeable."

    "With everything else that happened this morning though, I feel it might just be worth it."

    "Saki's already on her feet, one crutch firmly wedged under each armpit."

    "She's clearly favoring her right leg again, her ankle lifted on the ground, but she looks in good spirits."

    Hisao "I'll meet you after class, then?"

    "I ask, as we walk and cli-chack our way towards the locker rooms."

    "Since her class is right on the way to the art room, it makes more sense, especially if she's going to be in her wheelchair again."

    Saki "Then band after, right?"

    "She confirms, looking up at me."

    "I nod my approval."

    Hisao "Need any more help?"

    "I habitually ask, looking down at Saki's crutches."

    Saki "I think I can manage the shower myself... but... I'll keep the offer in mind,"

    "She ends with a giggle."

    "I'm so used to it now that I don't even blush, but instead roll my eyes."

    Hisao "Yeah, yeah, realized it the moment I said it."

    Saki "Maybe you're the one who could use a hand? You did hit your head pretty hard..."

    "Alright, that one gets to me."

    "I should have learned by now not to fight it."

    "I only end up more shocked when she raises the stakes."

    "When I don't answer, she continues, her voice teasing me again."

    Saki "It's only been a few weeks since you started this, but there's already a difference. You're looking pretty good, you know."

    "I'm reminded of the fact that she saw - and touched - my chest earlier."

    "I dip my chin a little lower, wishing my hair was a little longer so it would cover my cheeks which are now completely red from embarrassment."

    Saki "Hey,"

    "She says, gently elbowing me in the ribs, forcing me to look at her."

    "She smiles mischievously and winks at me."

    Saki "Don't you know? Chicks dig scars."

    Hisao "Damnit,"

    "I exhale, smiling and silently cracking up inside at how she manages to completely take the edge off a situation by attacking it head on."

    Hisao "I still have no idea how you do that."

    Saki "Good,"

    "She says, with a self satisfied smug."

    Saki "Keep 'em guessing."

    "I shake my head and laugh, despite the pain."

    Hisao "See you after class, Saki."
