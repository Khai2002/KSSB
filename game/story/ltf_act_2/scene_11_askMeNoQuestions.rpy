    "I've made my share of regretful decisions in my life, but I'm having a hard time thinking of anything in recent memory that tops the one I made yesterday."

    "My head still reels from the jargon and all its implications."

    "I don't remember exactly what time I left the library yesterday, but the sun was low enough in the sky to cast some very long shadows on my way back to my dorm."

    "There will never be a time in my life again where I won't know what I learned yesterday."

    "I learned about spinocerebellar ataxia."

    "Spinocerebellar ataxia, commonly abbreviated as SCA, is a progressive, degenerative, genetic disease with multiple types."

    # "I learned about its multiple types."

    "About how there were over a dozen different known types, some well documented, some only having a handful of cases."

    "Spinocerebellar ataxia is a hereditary and often fatal neurodegenerative disorder."

    "I learned about the symptoms."

    "From balance problems, to twitching eyes and limbs, to losing coordination and strength, to body tremors, and other things that can get progressively worse."

    "There is no known effective treatment or cure."

    "I learned about different prognoses."

    "I learned about the time clock each sufferer faces."

    "I learned at what years they could expect to see their bodies break down, and in what order it would happen."

    "I learned if they could expect the clock to stop at a certain point, or continue to its inevitable conclusion."

    "Spinocerebellar ataxia can affect anyone of any age."

    "Oh yeah."

    "I learned, alright."

    "And most important of all, I learned that yesterday I made a huge mistake."

    "The worst thing about it all? It was all fruitless because I don't even know what type of ataxia Saki has."

    "Because of this, it's been impossible to keep from jumping to conclusions."

    "I've been replaying everything Saki's said and done the last few weeks, along with what others have been saying about her, trying to find mental reassurance that the ataxia she has is one of the ones that isn't that bad."

    "She can play the violin after all, and she's in the art club, so she can't have one that's serious, right?"

    "I'm back in the library, during our lunch hour."

    "I managed to trudge through another day of morning classes, and working with Maeda and the dynamic duo."

    "Shizune seemed annoyed at first that my portion of the answer packet was woefully lacking, but a silent conversation with Misha combined with the facial expression I must have been wearing this morning quickly dismissed any thoughts of her chiding me."

    "At any rate, we managed to get some more work done on the project, with Shizune stepping in to take up my rather obvious slack."

    "I simply told them I wasn't feeling too well, and that the new medication I was on must have been messing with my sleep schedule."

    "It wasn't entirely a lie."

    "Maeda seemed indifferent and bored like he always does, and the two girls didn't pry any further."

    "Nobody mentioned Saki."

    "The rest of the morning classes went rather smoothly."

    "I learned to coast on autopilot quite early in my academic career, and while I normally use that skill to cover me while I daydream or think about more interesting things, I find it very useful for when there's heavier things on my mind."

    "So here I sit again, staring at the same packet, the same book in front of me."

    "It's almost enough to make me wish I had simply dozed off here at this desk and the last twenty four hours was just a bad dream."

    "I'm interrupted in my thoughts by a voice I recognize."

    Hisao "Hey."

    "I wave, trying to put on a smile."

    "I haven't seen her or Noriko the last two days either, not since the night we went to the city."

    "I wait until she's a little closer to the table I'm at before speaking again, out of respect to the other people in the room."

    Hisao "What's up?"

    Chi "We hadn't seen you in a few days."

    "She starts, pulling out a chair and turning it backwards."

    "In one smooth motion, she straddles it and crosses her arms to rest on the back."

    "I'm shocked for a second at what a, well, unladylike gesture it is, but Chisato doesn't seem to notice or care at all."

    Hisao "Yeah, um, sorry. Class has been busy the last two days. We've been working on a group project."

    # "I offer up lamely."

    Chi "So that's why you've been skipping lunch with the two of us, huh?"

    "Chisato teases, her trademark twinkle in her eye."

    Chi "It's alright. We've been kind of exhausted after, you know."

    Hisao "How is she?"

    "I ask before I can stop myself. I hadn't received any texts from Saki since the ones two nights ago, and Chisato's disarming demeanor is making me forget that it's pretty rude to talk about someone when they're not there in your presence."

    Chi "She's okay, for the most part."

    "Chisato answers, a little bit of light fading from her cheery expression."

    Chi "More ego than anything, I think."

    "I think about asking her about the strange interaction the two of them had that night, with Saki on the ground and Chisato helping her, but I think better of it."

    "I know that would be out of line, and I already did enough of that yesterday."

    Hisao "That's good."

    Chi "That reminds me. Can you do me a favor? I had to run back to class to get something I left, so Saki's down in the cafeteria... do you want to go see her? I don't know if I'll be able to make it back before the break ends, so I can't wheel her to her next class..."

    "That sounds equally lame to what I said earlier, and flimsy to boot."

    "But there's something in the way Chisato says it that makes me pause."

    "She continues, a bit softer, the unspoken subtext painfully clear, even to an obtuse idiot like me."

    Chi "She'd probably be really happy to see you."

    Hisao "Alright. I'm hungry anyway."

    "Chisato smiles and bounds up, easily flipping the chair back to its normal position."

    Chi "Good! Glad that's settled."

    Hisao "Chisato, were you actually looking for me?"

    Chi "Who, me? Of course not."

    Chi "I just stuck my head in the door passing by and you happened to be here, that's all."

    Hisao "I thought your class was down the hall, by the elevators. It isn't even in this part of the building."

    "Chisato shrugs, refusing to admit anything."

    "A quick glance around doesn't reveal anything, except that the stockpile of pre-made items available for selection seems to have been raided pretty thoroughly."

    # "Great."

    # "Another, more attentive look around this time."

    "I scan the back of student's heads, not immediately seeing Saki."

    "It's not until I realize there's only about a half dozen tables that a wheelchair could be parked in front of that I finally see her."

    "Her back's to me, so while I can see a tray of food in front of her, I don't see what's on it."

    "Seeing her in a wheelchair, even from a distance, sparks a flash of pity in me."

    "Not because I feel sorry for her, but because even from here I can see from her body language that she's not feeling well."

    "Maybe there was something to what her friend said and seeing me will cheer her up."

    "After yesterday, it will be good to see her, even with my self imposed circumstances."

    "I take the long way around, grabbing an apple out of a bin."

    "Contrary to what I told Chisato, I'm not actually hungry, but I should be eating something anyway."

    "I don't see her cane anywhere on her though, so she must not be walking at all yet."

    "As a result, neither of us seem to want to steer the discussion in that direction."

    "A few more minutes of talk drags on as I finish my apple and Saki her drink."

    "I look at my watch and see there's still about twenty minutes left in the break, and that Chisato is nowhere to be seen."

    "I'm not naive enough to think she's not here on accident."

    Saki "So... I guess this is the part where I tell you about my ataxia, right?"

    Hisao "I didn't mean it that way."

    Saki "It's all right."

    "Saki says, with a heavy sigh that tells me she's resigning herself to a conversation she really doesn't like having."

    Saki "I'm... not sure when something like that will happen again, but... I know it will. I guess I just have to take it a bit easier, is all."

    Hisao "Is it because of the type of SCA you have?"

    "Saki looks at me sharply, her eyes flashing with accusation."

    "My pulse quickens along with my confusion."

    "She just offered to tell me about her ataxia, and while I know that this isn't easy for either of us to talk about, I can't think of how what I said would trigger that reaction."

    Saki "How did you know it was called SCA, Hisao?"

    "Saki asks me, in a low monotone."

    Hisao "What do you mean?"

    "I stammer out, a sense of dread mixing with my ever building puzzlement."

    "Saki gives an smirk that doesn't reach her eyes, which are still bright with anger."

    Saki "Two weeks ago, you'd never heard of ataxia. Now you know you know it's called SCA and that there are different types."

    "She finishes, turning her face away from mine again, her mouth setting in a hard line."

    "Oh..."

    "..."

    "Oh shit."

    "I was trying so hard not to bring it up like this."

    "I spent the better part of a day specifically trying to figure out how to avoid bringing it up like this."

    "But one simple betrayal of the tongue, a quick lapse in my concentration, and it's all out in the open."

    "I'm glad Saki isn't looking at me to see the shame that paints my face."

    "Neither of us say anything for a few more seconds."

    "I can feel my heart beating hard in my chest, my face flushed."

    "This was a mistake."

    "It was a mistake to address this."

    "It was a mistake to even look it up."

    Saki "You didn't answer my question, Hisao."

    "Caught in the crosshairs, I take the only option available to me, and the one I know I should have taken from the very start."

    "The truth."

    Hisao "I was curious after what happened that night, and after Nurse spoke to me, I went to the library and looked up some information on it."

    "Saki's countenance drops some of its anger, replaced by a mild panic that mirrors what I'm feeling."

    Saki "Nurse didn't say anything, did he?"

    Hisao "No, he didn't."

    "I reply, shaking my head."

    Hisao "He told me that it would be a good idea to tell you about my arrhythmia, and checked to see if I was okay, but that was it."

    Saki "So, nobody said anything to you, then? You just decided to look it up on your own?"

    "She asks, her shoulders slumping in a slight gesture of relief."

    "I can't figure out why she's acting this way."

    "She seems more scared that someone told me about her condition than she seems upset about me looking it up."

    "Saki's never been shy about her cane, or asking for help, or even jokingly using her condition to her advantage when it suits her, but this is something different entirely."

    "It's like once the conversation turns serious, her priorities completely switch from..."

    "From what? What I think they should be? What they would be if it was me in the same situation?"

    "God, I screwed this up."

    Hisao "Pretty much. I mean, after that night and what happened, and hearing from Misha yesterday that you were in a wheelchair, and Maeda commenting on it, I-"

    Saki "What did Maeda say?"

    "Saki cuts me off, her tone sharp, yet incredibly brittle."

    Hisao "He just said that he wasn't surprised you were in a wheelchair... whatever that means."

    "I offer feebly."

    "I watch Saki's face as it trembles with emotions."

    "Her brow twitches along with the muscles at the corner of her mouth, as she takes a wavering breath."

    "I can see so many thoughts rage through her mind, each causing a reaction that she can't settle on."

    "All at once, her composure breaks completely."

    "She closes her eyes hard, blinking back tears."

    "She buries her face in her hands, hiding it from me."

    Saki "That asshole."

    "She sobs."

    Saki "That fucking asshole..."

    "Her entire body starts shaking with the force of her crying."

    "I raise my hand towards her but stop it, unsure of what to do."

    "Every sound she's making is tearing at my very core, knowing I'm partially responsible for it."

    "I can think of nothing else but to get up and head towards the sink, my legs and arms moving in the wooden motions of a marionette with tangled strings."

    "I'm guided on instinct and not conscious thought as I grab a clean cloth hanging from the rack to bring back to her."

    Hisao "Saki."

    "I say, bending down to her and pressing the cloth into her hand."

    Hisao "Saki, I'm sorry..."

    "She doesn't answer me, but instead clenches the fabric so tight in her shaking fist that the knuckles turn white."

    "She manages to bring it up to her face, pressing it against her forehead."

    "I don't know what to say, but I do know that anything I could say would be wrong."

    "I decide to keep my mouth shut, biting my tongue."

    "Saki's sobs eventually start to quiet down, her shoulders shaking less and less."

    "She wipes her eyes and then blows her nose, the sharp sound overpowering any of the ambient noise bearing witness in the room."

    Saki "You asked me what type of ataxia I had."

    "Saki finally manages to say, her voice shaky."

    "A deep breath does little to calm it."

    "Her eyes, rimmed with red and alive with a golden fire of desperation, lock into mine."

    Saki "Are you sure you want to know?"

    "This is the last moment I have to stop this set of events I put into place by sitting down at that damned computer yesterday."

    "I could say no, and end this, and let Saki alone."

    "She wouldn't have to be having this painful conversation anymore, and we could just forget about it."

    "Even as the thought forms in my head, I know it's futile."

    "I could say yes, and wipe away blissful ignorance."

    "I don't know what the answer would be, but there's a very real part of me that's scared of finding out something I don't want to know...but all the wishing in the world doesn't make painful truths any less painful."

    "This moment has been building for the last few weeks, from the first time we opened up to each other under the stars of the festival."

    "No, even sooner than that."

    "It's been building since the first day I met her, the day she caught me looking at her as she climbed the stairs."

    "Regardless of what happens here, our friendship will change."

    "There's been enough dancing around this issue on my part."

    "Whatever the truth is, I owe it to Saki to let her tell me what it is, especially after pushing it this far."

    "I nod."

    "Saki keeps her eye contact with me."

    Saki "You read how some types were better than others?"

    "I nod again, a very, very dim ember of hope starting to burn in my chest."

    "Maybe it's not as bad as I think, and it's just one of the types of ataxia that affects balance, or coordination..."

    "Saki breaks her eyes from mine and turns her gaze to the floor again."

    "The corner of her mouth curls in a sad smile."

    show saki reminisce
    with dissolve

    Saki "I don't have one of those types."

    "She says, in a voice so soft it amazes me with how crushing its weight is."

    "And just like that, the last puzzle piece falls into place and the assemblage flips over to show the whole picture."

    "All the comments the last few weeks, from Saki, from Ms. Sakamoto, from Maeda and Chisato, to the therapy, the swimming, the twisted ankle, the recording studio..."

    "It all makes sense, and now I know."

    "Damn me, I know."

    Hisao "I-"

    "I begin, but Saki cuts me off."

    Saki "Don't."

    "Saki says."

    Saki "Don't apologize. Don't say something like 'I'm sorry' or 'I understand.' Just please don't, okay? Not right now."

    Hisao "... alright."

    Saki "It's not that bad, yet..."

    Saki "Right now it's just my legs and balance, and a few small problems I can deal with from day to day. I mean, until that night, I'd only fallen like that once, and it was a few years ago, when I first..."

    "She trails off, biting her lower lip."

    "I can hear the quiver in her voice."

    "She gave me the chance to back out of this conversation, and I have to offer her the same."

    "Besides that, I'm not sure I'd be able to handle much more of this anyway."

    "My heart and soul hasn't felt this heavy since I was in the hospital, learning just how my life had changed."

    Hisao "We don't have to talk about it right now, if you don't want to."

    "I say, my voice barely audible."

    "She pauses long enough to make me realize she's going to take me up on that offer, even before she nods her approval."

    "But just when I think she's starting to recover, her face twists and she starts to cry again."

    Hisao "Are you okay?"

    "I ask, equally knowing that she isn't and that there's nothing I can really do."

    Saki "You must think I'm a horrible person."

    "She says to me."

    Saki "I wasn't hiding it, I just..."

    "I'm genuinely hurt by that statement, and I can hear it in my voice when I answer."

    Hisao "Why would you think that?"

    Saki "I just... I..."

    "Saki sighs."

    Saki "How many people do you think you're going to stay friends with after we graduate, Hisao?"

    "The way she responds to my question with another question takes me aback."

    "Reflex brings my answer quickly."

    Hisao "I'm not sure..."

    "I really don't know."

    "I can't sit here and say I would keep contact with everyone in my class, or this school, when I don't keep contact with anyone from my old school."

    "Granted, there's a reason, but..."

    Saki "I don't want pity. I wasn't hiding it, I just... didn't go into the details unless someone asked. And not many people have."
    
    Saki "As soon as word gets out it's going to be nothing but 'Poor Saki' this and 'Poor Saki' that and that's the only thing that's going to matter... If I can just get through this year and out of here, then it won't be as big an issue..."

    "I don't know how to respond, but I can't look at Saki."

    "Whether it's the feeling of guilt I have that I can't define from bringing this up with her, or the way that her soft, intermittent sobs tear at my heart, I simply can do nothing but stare at the floor."

    Hisao "I'm sorry."

    "I whisper, the words so inadequate."

    Saki "Why?"

    "Saki laughs, her voice a sharp, derisive bark."

    Saki "It's not your fault I'm like this... I mean, you'd find out eventually, right? Whether from Nurse or Maeda or looking it up online, you'd figure something out if we kept on like this because I simply can't come out and tell you on my own about it..."

    "Before I know what I'm doing, I'm kneeling in front of her chair, reaching up to take both her hands between mine."

    Hisao "Saki."

    "I say, a note of desperation bleeding into my voice."

    Hisao "Saki, stop."

    "She stops talking, but I can't see her eyes."

    "All I can see is the her cheeks below her bangs, wet with tears."

    "I can feel her hands trembling."

    Hisao "Saki, I'm sorry. It was wrong of me to do what I did. I shouldn't have looked it up the way I did. I should have talked to you."

    "I say, taking a breath."

    Hisao "After what happened the other night when you hurt yourself, I had no idea how to even approach you about it, but it's my fault I didn't."

    "I squeeze in what I hope is a reassuring gesture but I'm scared it's having the opposite effect."

    Hisao "If anyone else finds out, I promise it won't be from me, okay?"

    "Saki nods silently, still not showing me her eyes."

    "I smile weakly."

    Hisao "I mean, as long as you don't tell people I have a time bomb for a heart."

    "All the strength leaves Saki's body as she laughs through her tears, pitching forward."

    "I'm startled, but have little time to recover as she tips too far forward for the chair."

    "I panic briefly and move to catch her as she falls."

    "There's a clattering noise as the wheelchair rolls backwards and bumps into the wall."

    "We're both on our knees, my arms around Saki for support, her frame pressed against mine."

    "Her arms wrap around my shoulders as I can feel her shuddering from barely repressed laughter."

    "After a few long moments like this, I sense something change in Saki's demeanor... she's still shaking, but it's somehow different."

    "It becomes calmer, yet more sporadic."

    "Her arms tighten around me, hard, and I instinctively return the gesture."

    "After another few moments locked together like this, I feel a warm dampness on my shoulder where she's buried her face into it."

    "All I can do at this moment is hold her."

    "All I want to do at this moment is hold her."

    Saki "Thank you."

    "She manages to get out through a cracking voice."

    "I think about how we should have been to class a long time ago."

    "I think about how ridiculous this looks."

    "I think about what would happen if someone walked in and saw us now."

    "I think about Saki's knee, and if this position is hurting her or not."

    "I think about how this is too much to process in one sitting like this, and I probably won't sleep for the next day or two."

    "And right now, I think about how none of that matters."
