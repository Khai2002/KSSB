    Chi "Me, I was up a lot later and I didn't eat much. What's your excuse?"

    Hisao "Trying to keep up with Saki yesterday."

    # "I answer with a smirk."

    # "This only causes Chisato to laugh even harder."

    Hisao "I did. Seems like it was just what I needed, honestly."

    Chi "Good! By the way, thanks for keeping her company yesterday. I wanted to swing by earlier but there was just so much stuff that had to be done and nothing was going right."

    "I think back to getting food at Lilly's stall and the problems she said they were facing."

    Hisao "Nothing goes as planned, does it?"

    Hisao "Not with an event like that. Overall though, it went pretty well from what I heard."

    "A thought strikes my mind as I'm watching Chisato eat."

    Hisao "So, you're diabetic, right? You just tested your blood sugar?"

    Chi "Mhmm."

    Hisao "I thought whenever you did that, you had to inject yourself with insulin."

    # "I start to say, but as soon as I finish that sentence I see Chisato shaking her head as she swallows."

    Chi "Not me, I don't have to do that. I have something a bit more direct."

    "She leans back in the chair and turns sideways, lifting up her shirt above the top of her skirt."

    "I see a black box about the size of a pack of cards clipped the waistband of the green fabric, with a display on the front and a tube snaking out of sight."

    "She waits for me to get a good look at it before she drops her shirt back down."

    "Now that I know what to look for, I can see the bulge it makes."

    Chi "Insulin pump. All I have to do is hit a button or two on it and it does all that for me."

    # "She pats her side for emphasis."

    Chi "It's a lot easier than sticking myself with a needle every time. Less painful too. I only need to put in a new needle every few days."

    Hisao "I thought diabetes had to do with what you ate."

    # "I comment, wracking my brain for everything I know about diabetes, which admittedly isn't much."

    Chi "Sometimes, but that's usually something with type two diabetics. I'm type one."

    Hisao "I didn't even know there was more than one type."

    show chisato neutral
    with dissolve

    Chi "Most people don't. Type one diabetics don't produce insulin, so that's why I need the pump. Type two diabetics make it but build up resistance to it. Type one is pretty rare."

    "The memories of the defibrillators along the walls along with remembering the term 'diabetic coma' prompts my next question."

    Hisao "So if something, uh, goes wrong, I guess... what are the people around you supposed to do?"

    Chi "Force feed me syrup."

    # "She answers, in such a straight tone of voice that I must look stunned."

    Chi "No, seriously! The only thing that can really go wrong like that is me passing out because I didn't get enough to eat. So I need sugar."

    Chi "Well, I guess I could always get a bad batch of insulin or something could go wrong with the pump, but I'd notice before it got that bad. That only happened once."

    Hisao "Seems like a lot to keep track of."

    Chi "You get used to it. I mean, don't you take medications or vitamins or something?"

    Hisao "So many that I'm amazed I don't sound like a baby rattle when I walk."

    # "I concede with a sigh."

    # "Chisato laughs and continues to eat."

    "We make some small talk between various food items, and the rest of the lunch period passes by quickly. We deposit our trash in the can, placing our trays - and Saki's - on the small counter next to it."

    Chi "You know. We're going into town today, but Saki and I were going to go into the city later this week. We had a few things to do, and I think she needed to pick up some things for her fish tank. You want to come with?"

    Hisao "Huh, I hadn't thought of that. I just assumed I could get what I needed down in town."

    show chisato smileclosed

    Chi "Nope. The Aura Mart sells some cat and dog food, but nothing for fish. You have to go to the city for that."

    "Well, it could be a nice chance to explore. And besides, I don't think I would object to spending some more time with these two. I enjoyed spending much of the first week and festival around them, after all."

    Hisao "Alright. Just let me know what day."

    "It's interesting to analyze the strange mix of emotions that flood through me when I say that."

    "I'm surprised that I said it in the first place, as I've always tended to be a little introverted. There's a feeling of relief that I said it, and also a realization I genuinely am looking forward to it."

    "I've always been the type of person that has to focus on something in the future to keep me oriented. It can be something as far out as Christmas, or something as soon as the next day. And now that I have something happening in a few days, getting to that point is all the much easier."

    "That's one of the things that just absolutely crushed me in the hospital. There were milestones in my recovery, for sure... but it can be hard to appreciate them in the moment."

    "I think the only thing I ever really looked forward to in the hospital was the meatloaf on Thursdays."
    
    "I push those thoughts out of my head to save both my sanity and my gag reflex."

    Chi "We'll let you know when we figure it out!"

    "Chisato says cheerily, starting to pick up her pace to outdistance my leisurely one."

    "From the speed at which she moves, it's clear she wants to make one or two more stops before going back to class. I watch her retreating back, my eyes drawn to the slight bump at her right hip."

    "I stop and just stare at Chisato. My reaction seems to be the one she wanted to see, because she winks again and turns away with another laugh. She practically jogs down the hallway and turns at the end of it, leaving me standing there rubbing by temples."

    Hisao "Great. Here we go again."

    "It seems obvious that both Chisato and Saki like to tease everyone, including each other."

    "Shizune seems to do this too, but unlike with her, there doesn't seem to be any type of challenging zeal or competition to it."

    "It's not exactly annoying, but it's quickly becoming one of those quirky things you realize you're just going to have to put up with if you want to be friends with that person."

    "And yet, as I reach the staircase and start to make my ascent to my classroom, that strange mix of apprehension and excitement doesn't exactly get weaker after what Chisato said."

    "Pop quiz tomorrow. Focus on that instead. Study for that tonight."

    "And if that doesn't work, there's always a cold shower."
