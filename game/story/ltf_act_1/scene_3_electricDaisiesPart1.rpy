    "The alarm clock sears through my head with all the subtlety of a speeding train."

    "I reflexively flop over, fumbling blindly to smash it, but to no avail."

    "I clip the corner of it, and it makes a leap for safety - right down behind my nightstand. To add insult to injury, I hear rattling as it takes several pill bottles with it."

    "I sit up and swing my legs out over the edge of the bed in one swift motion, wanting to get this over with as soon as possible."

    "Standing, I lean over the edge of the nightstand to see the cruel red display staring maliciously back at me."

    "It takes a few seconds, but I'm finally able to silence it and put it back in its place along with half of my medications."

    "It takes a bit longer for the cobwebs in my head to completely clear. There's no class today, so I had set the alarm for a bit later than I usually would... but I didn't think I'd actually sleep in until eleven."

    "I guess the rigors of this first week at Yamaku ended up taking a bigger toll on me than I thought."

    "I stretch, the sore muscles in my back protesting."

    "My sleep schedule still isn't normal, so I either wake up incredibly early like the time Saki rescued me from Shizune, or I find myself barely making it to class."

    "I idly wonder if part of it could be because of my medication as I wrestle with the top of a bottle. Maybe I should talk to Nurse about it."

    "Yawning, I step over to the window and take a look outside."

    "Not only is it Sunday, but it's the day of the festival as well. I can see a few people lingering around between the various booths and stalls set up, half of which must be students."

    "Maybe it's still early for too many people to show up."

    "I didn't really have any plans for the day myself.
    There are a few tests this next week I need to study for, but I shouldn't have a problem with them."

    "I hear some shouting drift up from down below and look to see a group setting up rows of seating before the stage."

    "I gave them a hand in setting it up yesterday because Saki asked me to, but I didn't realize they were setting it up right under my window."

    "Chisato is directing a pair of fellow students with chairs under their arms with the precision of someone on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier."

    "Saki had roped me into helping yesterday purely by chance, or at least, that's what she'd claim if questioned."

    "I had woken up insanely early, and was unable to get back to sleep. I had surrendered to the thought of it being a long day and decided to take a walk around campus to kill time before classes started, something I've started doing more recently this week."

    "I ran into Saki completely by coincidence over by the arts wing, heading back towards her dorm carrying a gym bag over her shoulder."

    "Joining her on the walk back, I found out she had a morning routine of heading to the school pool early before the day truly started. I didn't think much of it, equating it to my morning walk or Emi's morning runs."

    "After she dropped her bag off, we grabbed breakfast again in the cafeteria and I asked her how the festival preparations were going."

    "Between bites of bland eggs and burnt toast I learned everything was nearly ready except setting up the collapsible stage for the performance the day after."

    "Without thinking, I asked if there was anything I could do to help, and sure enough, hours later I was wrestling with lengths of pipe and various hand tools."

    "Okay... maybe I exaggerated when I say she roped me into it."

    "My stomach growls as I finish taking the last of my morning medications. I should probably head down to get something to eat; I'm curious to check out the festival anyway, and I'd like to see the band performance later, especially after skinning my knuckles setting up the stage yesterday."

    "Some people are parents or guardians of students, as evidenced by someone in uniform showing them around and pointing out various things."

    "Still others are there by themselves, and I can't help but notice most of these are in an older age bracket."

    "Come to think of it, I noticed that earlier in the week when I went down into town to go shopping."

    "This must be one of those towns where the only people left are those that lived here their whole lives and refuse to leave, or those wanting to live out the rest of their lives in one of the increasingly few tranquil places."

    "That must be one of the reasons Yamaku's atmosphere is so easygoing and laid back, not that I mind one bit.
    I like how calming Yamaku is, especially after what happened to land me here."

    "The humidity, though, is another matter entirely."

    "I'm shaken from my thoughts by a loud clanging of bells blaring from the school's PA system. I stand up, and a few of the people near me share my reaction."

    "I hear the principal make a garbled announcement over it, officially declaring the opening of the festival, already well in full swing."

    "The statement draws varied responses from the people around me.
    Some smile, others groan, and interestingly enough most of the students I see don't react at all."

    "I imagine they wouldn't, given they've been in the festival mindset for the last week."

    "When the voice goes silent, everyone gives polite applause before going back to whatever it was they were doing."

    "I stare down at the now empty plate, wondering how I'm going to spend my day.
    I could go get another plate of takoyaki; this one wasn't that bad."

    "Rin was working frantically at her mural up until the last moment.
    I could go see how that turned out."

    "I could go see what time the band is having its performance.
    I could check out some of the games that have been set up."

    "Or I could just retreat back to some place quiet like the rooftop or the library."

    "Still undecided but opting to move, I throw the plate into a trashbin and lose myself among the flow of people."

    "I make up my mind to start over by the booth on the end of the line and head down."

    Saki "So many people that end up here fall into the same trap."

    #"She says, closing her eyes."

    Saki "Some are like Lilly, or Shizune, or Rin, where they're born with issues so they haven't lost anything. 
    Then others come here because they lost everything."
    
    Saki "Car crash, heart attack, diving accident, some doctor tells them there's a tumor in their brain that will kill them before they're thirty... it doesn't matter what happens, just that something does."

    "She pauses for a breath, letting it out slowly, as if trying to order her thoughts in her head before speaking again."

    Saki "They get here, they run into people who try to treat them like they're made of glass, and they shut down. They never accept what happens because people around them keep trying to sweep it under the rug like it never happened."

    Saki "So they feel like failures because they can't get over it when everyone is trying to tell them they should. And they just... give up."

    Saki "..."

    Saki "Nobody says 'It's okay to feel sorry for yourself once in a while. It's okay to think that whatever happened to you isn't fair. It's okay to get pissed off and cry and scream and punch a wall or throw something.' So they get into their own little world of pity and never come out of it."

    Saki "I don't want to see that happen to you, Hisao."

    "I'm stunned. That's the only word I can use to describe it, and it's so inadequate."

    "In the months since my heart attack, everyone around me - my parents, my friends, my doctors, even and especially Iwanako - have all tried their best to cheer me up, to make me feel normal."

    "It's painfully obvious when it's forced. Saki's completely right - it did start to wear at me."

    "My parents even tried to be optimistic about Yamaku, saying it was an opportunity."

    "By that point I was so pissed off and wallowing in self pity that I was resenting every good-natured attempt around me out of habit."

    "By trying their best to make sure the full weight of what happened never hit me, I still haven't truly been able to mourn for anything I've lost."

    "Thinking back, I did deal with a small handful of people during my hospital stay that were frank and open with me, and I appreciated it."

    "I even find Mutou's concerns and Nurse's lecturing refreshing, when compared to the way people were treating me beforehand."

    "They haven't tried to avoid or tiptoe around my issues, or the problems of anyone else for that matter."

    "By addressing those issues, they just make them another part of everyday life and not some black sheep or elephant in the room."

    "There's a very large difference between someone telling you what you want to hear, and someone telling you what you need to hear."

    "Sometimes, you don't even recognize the difference until someone does... well... whatever it was that Saki just did."

    "A small smile comes to my face with the sheer irony and absurdity of it all."
