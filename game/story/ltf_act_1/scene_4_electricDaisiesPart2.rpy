    "I look down at the cane I have in my hand, and turn it in my fingertips, idly contemplating it."

    "The shaft is about a meter long, with a rubber cleat on one end and a molded plastic handle coated in a thin layer of rubber on the other. A small loop of braided cord hangs from one end of the handle to slip a wrist through."

    "I confirm that it's a bit beefier than I would have thought, but I'm no expert in these things."

    "After a few seconds another one starts up, the tempo slightly upbeat compared to the previous tune. It sounds a bit playful actually, and before I know it I'm tapping my heel in time with the rhythm. Once again, there's no real effort to have certain elements outshine the others."

    "With the change in mood, I look at the students again. More now have a positive look on their faces, while some have intense looks of concentration as the song slips in and out of complexity."

    "They're dancing."

    "I've never had a big taste in music. I don't have any real favorite genre."

    "I don't have any presets on my radio back home, or any posters for bands hanging on my wall."

    "Some of those moments are good, some of them are painful."

    "Like my appreciation for most things, music was tainted by my long hospital stay."

    "When I was first admitted to the hospital, I spent several weeks in a shared intensive care ward."

    "None of the doors could be closed so each room and bed had a direct line of sight to the nurse's station."

    "That particular station had a radio that played day in and day out, recycling the same dozen songs every two hours."

    "I didn't mind at first, but then they started to cut back the good medication."

    "You can only hear the same song so many times before you begin to understand why the doctors don't keep sharp instruments in the patient rooms."

    "Being moved to a shared recovery room with one other person didn't help much either. They insisted on playing their radio on the same station as well, and they happened to be on the side of the room with the radio."

    "It wasn't until after nearly two months that I got my own room and sweet, blessed silence."

    "I guess I'm trying to say I'd grown kind of numb to music as a whole the last few months."

    "All that said, before I know it, I'm completely absorbed in what I'm hearing."

    "A quick look around me shows that many other people are having the same reaction I am."

    "Rapt attention."

    "Far away, there are still the sounds of the festival. People laughing, children shouting, and the general hustle and noise."

    "But right now, all that exists is this little bubble and the control the two on stage have of it."

    "And with that, Saki and I make our way back towards the dorms, tracing the same route we used earlier to get to the stage in the first place."

    "There's still the sound of people, but most of the noise has quieted down to where I can hear the gentle clacking of Saki's cane every time it touches the ground."

    Saki "So, Hisao..."

    #"She says in step beside me."

    Saki "Did you enjoy the festival?"

    Hisao "Yeah."

    "And I truly mean it."

    Hisao "I think after this week and after everything else, I really needed it."

    Saki "Good."

    #"She answers, unable to hide the tiredness in her voice."

    Hisao "Not at all. I had a good time."

    "It was pretty amazing."

    "The entire day was, thinking back on it."

    "I didn't know what to expect when I woke up today. I wasn't even sure I was going to go to the festival at all, much less enjoy it."

    "It's kind of fitting given that my whole attitude towards Yamaku was similar when I first transferred in."

    "But the day ended up being fun."

    "Fun? No, not exactly the right word."

    "Peaceful."

    "Calming."

    "Enjoyable."

    "Mesmerizing is another good term for parts of it."

    "I realize that I didn't just enjoy the music, or the food, or the fireworks, but I enjoyed pretty much every way I spent my time today."

    "And who I spent that time with."

    Saki "Looks like this is where we part ways for the night."

    "We're in the courtyard before the dorms before I had even realized it."

    Saki "Get a good night's sleep, okay?"

    Hisao "I should be saying that to you. You're the one who can barely stand up."

    Saki "Hey, you're the new guy. Someone has to look out for you."

    Hisao "I thought you said I wasn't allowed to use that as an excuse anymore."

    Saki "Right. You can't. I can."

    "She giggles, turning away from me to start to walk towards the entrance to the female dorm."

    Hisao "Hey, Saki?"

    "I manage after she takes a few steps. She stops and turns around to face me."

    Hisao "Thank you."

    "Thank you for what? Thank you for spending time with me today."

    "Thank you for playing that song. Thank you for being concerned about me."

    "Thank you for reaching out to me this last week. Thank you for making me laugh."

    "Thank you for verbally slapping me and challenging me."

    "All of that passes through my mind in a second."

    "And I swear, after a brief moment when her face breaks into a warm smile, she's understood. All of that."

    Saki "You're welcome."

    "She replies, with just as much unspoken."

    "And with that, she turns and walks through the door, with it closing behind her."

    "I'm left standing in the courtyard to end the day, just as it really began hours ago."

    "Thank you for letting the day be fun, and thank you for showing me it was okay for me to have fun."

    "All I really had to do was just open my mind to the possibilities as to what could have happened today, and take that first step of leaving my dorm room."

    "It turned out to be a great decision."

    "Can I do the same thing with Yamaku, in general? With my new life? Can I just stop being bitter about it for long enough to actually accept that this might be a good thing?"

    "I don't know the answer to that, but I know that I'm going to try."
