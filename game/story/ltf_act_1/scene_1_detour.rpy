    "Ever since I introduced myself to the class, Shizune and Misha seem to have been monopolizing what little free time I have."

    "I appreciate them making the effort to make me feel welcome, but it can be more than a little exhausting."

    "This time though, I'm thankful for their interruption; Misha barging in saved me from a what was shaping up to be a fairly uncomfortable conversation with Mutou."

    "Not knowing what else to do, I decided to help Misha find what she needed, without stopping to think how much knowledge of my surroundings I would need to actually do this."

    "Thus the reason I'm wandering aimlessly around campus."

    "I find myself actually enjoying the walk around the grounds."

    "I haven't been able to do much walking at all in the last few months, and the afternoon sun on my skin and slight breeze running over me make me close my eyes and inhale the clean air deeply in appreciation."

    "It's such a stark contrast from the environment that was my existence until only recently; the overly filtered sterile air that always had an undertone of harsh chemicals and antiseptic, and the precisely controlled temperature with no variation at all."

    "When was the last time I did this? It feels like a lifetime ago."

    "I'm not sure just how large it is yet."

    "I've seen glimpses of a running track and athletic field out of the window in class, and there are a few other buildings scattered around the garden than just the dorms and the two I've been in."

    "I know the important things like my classroom in the main building, the dorms, the cafeteria, and the nurse's office in one of the auxiliary buildings."

    "The Nurse and the dynamic duo mentioned something about a swimming pool as well. Maybe I'll find it if I keep wandering around."

    "It was the first time since I got to Yamaku that I actually was able to let my guard down and relax a bit."

    "I had a very brief conversation with Hanako in the library and then spoke with Yuuko, who can only be described as 'intriguing'."

    "Another glance at the front of the building has me seeing a sign emblazoned over the main entrance that I didn't notice yesterday."

    Maybe if Yamaku has a theatre department, they'll have some plywood for their sets or know where to get some."

    she's wearing a pair of dark black socks that come up to just below her knees, and standard brown shoes... 
    which aren't alone in touching the ground."
