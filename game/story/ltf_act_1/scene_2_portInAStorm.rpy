    #"Saki just gives a slight nod with that knowing smile of hers and Chisato gives me a coy look."

    "Oh, great. What exactly have the two of them been talking about? I never know how to react in situations like this."

    Hisao "So... Saki's mentioned me, has she?"

    "I cast a sidelong glance at Saki. She shamelessly meets my gaze and raises an eyebrow."

    Chi "Don't worry. She hasn't said anything bad. Just telling me about a new guy she met."

    Hisao "Uh... huh."

    #"Before I can ponder this further, Saki speaks up."

    Saki "Chisato, can you take these to the band room? Hisao and I need to get breakfast before class starts. I'll swing by later to help finish up with the booth, okay?"

    Chi "Sure!"

    "Chisato reaches to take both the posterboard Saki has and the box I'm carrying and easily scoops them up in her arms."

    Chi "I'll see you later Saki, Nakai."

    "She gives a small nod in our direction and turns around to head back to the building."

    Hisao "She seems... nice."

    #"I manage to get out, not knowing what else to say but feeling I should say something."

    Saki "She's in the band with me. We've been friends for a few years now."

    #"Saki still clearly amused with the whole exchange and my reaction to it."

    Hisao "What exactly did you tell her about me?"

    Saki "Nothing!"

    Saki "Oh come on, don't be like that. Besides, Chisato saved us some time. Now we can go get breakfast."

    "For the third or fourth time this week, I feel completely dragged along by events that are out of my control."

    "You'd think I'd be getting used to it by now."

    Hisao "Where to? The cafeteria?"

    Saki "There's no place else, is there?"

    Hisao "I'm the new guy. You tell me."

    Saki "Nope, there isn't. Shall we?"

    #"She turns back towards the main building, beckoning me to follow. My stomach makes its presence known with the imminent promise of food."

    Hisao "Lead the way."
